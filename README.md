## Security Considerations

### Private Key Management
- Private keys are encrypted using AES-256
- Keys are stored securely using Expo SecureStore
- No private keys are transmitted over the network
- Backup and recovery mechanisms are implemented

### Transaction Security
- All transactions are signed locally
- Gas fees are calculated dynamically
- Transaction confirmation is required
- Address validation is performed

### Best Practices
- Never share your private keys
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable biometric authentication when available

## Demo Mode

The app currently runs in **demo mode** with:
- Mock wallet data (ETH, BTC, SOL)
- Simulated transactions
- Demo exchange rates
- No real blockchain interaction

This allows you to test all features safely before connecting to real networks.
